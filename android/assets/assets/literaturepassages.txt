Now this is the Law of the Jungle -- as old and as true as the sky; And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die.  As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back -- For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.
Kipling - "The Law of the Jungle"

Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into the gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery sandbanks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off forever from everything you had known once -somewhere- far away in another existence perhaps. There were moments when one's past came back to one, as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare to yourself; but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful aspect.
Conrad - Heart of Darkness
~
The wilderness has patted him on the head, and behold, it was like a ball -- an ivory ball; it had caressed him, and—lo!—he had withered; it had taken him, loved him, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favorite.
Conrad - Heart of Darkness
~
All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.
Golding - Lord of the Flies
~
It was dreadful in the forest. The trees grew so thickly and their foliage spread so widely that I could see nothing of the moon-light save that here and there the high branches made a tangled filigree against the starry sky... As the eyes became more used to the obscurity one learned that there were different degrees of darkness among the trees—that some were dimly visible, while between and among them there were coal-black shadowed patches, like the mouths of caves, from which I shrank in horror as I passed.
Doyle - The Lost World
~
The blue sky, the brown soil beneath, the grass, the trees, the animals, the wind, and rain, and stars are never strange to me; for I am in and of and am one with them; and my flesh and the soil are one, and the heat in my blood and in the sunshine are one.
Hudson - Green Mansions
~
Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody dared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than dawn. He was black as the ink it is used for writing; but the panther markings showed up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk.
Kipling - The Jungle Book
~
He had just changed his skin, and he was very new and splendid, with the thirty feet of him glowing like a dab of oil in the river... a huge yellow-and-black streak. The python made himself into a soft, swaying circle... his head moved with the rhythm of a metronome... He turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head from right to left. Then he began making loops and figures of eight with his body, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided figures, and coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying.
Kipling - The Jungle Book
~
But there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird—a silly little bird.
Conrad - Heart of Darkness

The edge of a colossal jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam... God-forsaken wilderness. Watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There it is before you -- smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with an air of whispering, "Come and find out."
Conrad - Heart of Darkness
~
When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all around you like something solid.
Conrad - Heart of Darkness
~
And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful aspect. The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness.
Conrad - Heart of Darkness
~
Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
KJV Bible - Psalm 104:20-22
~
Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies. Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand, dare seize the fire? And what shoulder, & what art, Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? & what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain, In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp, Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears And water'd heaven with their tears: Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night: What immortal hand or eye, Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
Blake - The Tyger
~
It is higher than a horse, has the feet of a bull, the head of a stag, and is white in color, but with spots like a leopard... it is of a gentle disposition, and is called the Camelopardalis.
Pliny the Elder confused about giraffes
~
From the dark woods that breathe of fallen showers, Harnessed with level rays in golden reins, The zebras draw the dawn across the plains Wading knee-keep among the scarlet flowers. The sunlight, zithering their flanks with fire, Flashes between the shadows as they pass Barred with electric tremors through the grass Like wind along the gold strings of a lyre. Into the flushed air snorting rosy plumes That smoulder round their feet in drifting fumes, With dove-like voices call the distant fillies, While round the herds the stallion wheels his flight, Engine of beauty volted with delight, To roll his mare among the trampled lilies.
Campbell - The Zebras
~
The jungle had swallowed the city... The roots of the peepul-trees had pried the stones of the walls apart, and the creepers had lashed the broken turrets with heavy knots... The Palace, that had once been the treasury of a King, was a hill of ruins, all grown over with heavy jungle-grass and young trees. A slab of the stone wall had fallen out, and the sun came through the hole in a long, dusty beam that danced on the floor... It was very cool and dark and quiet in there, and the noise of the outside world sounded as far away as the noise of the surf.
Kipling - The Jungle Book
~
He was quite white, as white as milk, and his eyes were like rubies... He had outlived his poison, as he had outlived his god... "I am the Warden of the King's Treasure," said the White Cobra. "I have been here since the city was built... The city is dead, but I am still here."
Kipling - The Second Jungle Book
~
A huge, bold mountain of granite... upon its summit the toppling ruins of the ancient city of Opar... The city was a ruin, yet the massive walls of the temples still stood, defying the ravages of the ages and the encroaching jungle. Great trees grew from the roofs of the buildings... It was a city of the dead, guarded by the living dead.
Burroughs - The Return of Tarzan
~
It was the Ancient of Days... a vast, brooding presence that had been there before the beginning of the world... It was not a place, but a Person... a huge, green, living thing that breathed and watched.
Blackwood - The Man Whom the Trees Loved
~
In the forest of the tableland... there were three distinct spheres of activity. The first was the ground... the second was the middle terrace, the trees... the third was the upper terrace, the swaying, perilous tree tops. This middle terrace was a broad and beautiful avenue... Here Tarzan was at home. He knew every branch and limb of the great giants that supported his airy world... He could swing from tree to tree with the speed of a squirrel, and with the strength of a great ape.
Burroughs - Tarzan of the Apes
~
To Tarzan the wind was a messenger... It brought him the sweet scent of the orchids, the musky smell of the civet, the pungent odor of the lion... He could track his prey by scent as easily as a hound tracks a fox... The jungle spoke to him in a language that was sealed to the heavy senses of the civilized man.
Burroughs - Tarzan of the Apes
~
Sabor was huge and fierce and terrible... Her yellow eyes were fixed upon the ape-man... Her tail lashed from side to side, and her great jaws were open, disclosing the long, yellow fangs. She did not roar now, but emitted a series of low, coughing grunts... the thunder of her challenge shook the ground.
Burroughs - Tarzan of the Apes
~
It was the survival of the fittest... The weak died that the strong might live. There was no mercy in the jungle... only the law of tooth and claw... The jungle was a hard mother, but she reared strong children.
Burroughs - Tarzan of the Apes
