The word jungle comes from the Sanskrit word jangala meaning uncultivated land.
~
The Amazon Rainforest produces approximately twenty percent of the world's oxygen.
~
Rainforests cover less than three percent of the Earth surface but are home to more than fifty percent of the world terrestrial animal species.
~
About twenty five percent of all natural medicines were discovered in rainforests yet less than one percent of these plants have been tested by scientists for medicinal properties.
~
The canopy layer is so dense that it can take ten minutes for a falling raindrop to reach the forest floor.
~
Rainforests generate their own rain as plants release water through transpiration which evaporates and forms clouds that water the forest again.
~
The world forests absorb about two point six billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.
~
If you weighed all the ants in the Amazon the ants would weigh more than all the mammals in the Amazon combined.
~
The rainforest floor is so dark that less than two percent of sunlight reaches it.
~
Some rainforests like the Daintree in Australia are over one hundred eighty million years old dating back to the age of dinosaurs.
~
The cacao tree from which chocolate is made originated in the Amazon basin.
~
The Amazon River carries more water than the next seven largest rivers in the world combined.
~
The Amazon rainforest is fertilized by phosphorus rich dust blown all the way from the Sahara Desert across the Atlantic Ocean.
~
Rainforest temperatures rarely drop below sixty four degrees Fahrenheit or rise above ninety three degrees Fahrenheit.
~
It is estimated that a swath of rainforest the size of forty football fields disappears every minute due to deforestation.
~
For a long time scientists thought there was only one species of giraffe but genetic research suggests there may be up to four distinct species.
~
A giraffe tongue can be up to twenty inches long and is dark blue or purple to protect it from sunburn while eating leaves.
~
Female giraffes give birth standing up meaning a newborn calf falls about five to six feet to the ground to enter the world.
~
Despite their long necks giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans just much larger.
~
Giraffes were long thought to be silent but they actually hum to each other at night at a frequency too low for human ears to hear.
~
No two giraffes have the same spot pattern it is as unique as a human fingerprint.
~
Giraffes have one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal needing only five to thirty minutes of sleep in a twenty four hour period.
~
A giraffe heart weighs about twenty five pounds and beats up to one hundred seventy times per minute to pump blood up to its brain.
~
Drinking water is dangerous for giraffes as they must spread their legs awkwardly to lower their heads making them vulnerable to predators.
~
The knob like structures on a giraffe head are called ossicones.
~
The massive beak of a toucan acts as a radiator allowing the bird to cool itself down or conserve heat by controlling blood flow.
~
The toucan beak looks heavy but is made of keratin with a honeycomb like interior making it incredibly light.
~
Toucans are not great at flying and mostly hop between branches or glide short distances.
~
To sleep a toucan turns its head backward and tucks its beak under its wing and tail resembling a ball of feathers.
~
Despite having bright colors toucans blend well into the dappled light of the rainforest canopy.
~
While toucans love fruit they are opportunistic eaters and will snack on insects lizards and even the eggs of other birds.
~
Toucans are among the loudest birds in the jungle with calls that can sound like frogs croaking or dogs barking.
~
In some toucan species the bill accounts for nearly fifty percent of the bird total body surface area.
~
Toucans have been observed wrestling with their beaks and tossing fruit to one another during mating rituals.
~
Toucans are native to the Neotropics from Southern Mexico to Northern Argentina.
~
The Toco Toucan is the largest and most recognizable species famous for its black body and giant orange beak.
~
A black panther is not a specific species but a melanistic color variant of either a leopard or a jaguar.
~
If you look closely at a black panther in bright sunlight you can still see the rosette patterns hidden in the dark fur.
~
The dark coat of a panther acts as perfect camouflage for hunting at night a phenomenon known as ghosting.
~
Unlike most house cats jaguars and black panthers love water and are excellent swimmers.
~
The jaguar has the strongest bite of all big cats relative to its size capable of biting through turtle shells and caiman skin.
~
Leopards and black panthers are incredibly strong climbers and often drag heavy kills up trees to protect them from scavengers.
~
Panthers are generally solitary animals only coming together to mate.
~
Panthers can roar due to a specialized ligament in their voice box but they do not purr.
~
In jaguars the black gene is dominant while in leopards the black gene is recessive.
~
Panthers are strictly carnivores and eat everything from deer and wild boar to fish and reptiles.
~
Black leopards are much rarer than spotted leopards as only about eleven percent of leopards are melanistic.
~
In many indigenous cultures the black jaguar is seen as a powerful spirit or a shapeshifter.
~
Like most cats panthers have retractable claws to keep them sharp for hunting and climbing.
~
The Florida Panther is actually a subspecies of cougar and is rarely black as reports of black panthers in North America are usually misidentifications.
~
Snakes use their forked tongues to collect chemical particles from the air which they analyze using the Jacobsons organ in the roof of their mouth.
~
Snakes do not have eyelids and cannot blink so their eyes are protected by a clear scale called a brille.
~
Snakes do not actually unhinge their jaws but have jaws connected by flexible ligaments that stretch allowing them to swallow prey larger than their heads.
~
Snakes lack external ears but hear by feeling vibrations in the ground through their jawbones.
~
The paradise tree snake of Southeast Asia can glide through the air by flattening its body into a wing like shape.
~
Snakes shed their skin all at once to allow for growth and to remove parasites.
~
Venomous snakes can control how much venom they inject and sometimes deliver dry bites with no venom as a warning.
~
The largest snake to ever live was the Titanoboa which lived in the jungle sixty million years ago and was forty two feet long.
~
The heaviest snake in the world is the Green Anaconda which can weigh over five hundred pounds.
~
The longest snake in the world is the Reticulated Python which can grow over thirty feet long.
~
Pit vipers pythons and boas have heat sensing pits on their faces that allow them to see the heat signature of prey in total darkness.
~
To fit inside thin snake bodies the paired organs are arranged one in front of the other and most have only one functional lung.
~
Some snakes can shut down their digestive system between meals to conserve energy then rebuild their gut rapidly when they eat.
~
All snakes are carnivores and there are no vegetarian snakes.
~
Snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica.
~
When the asteroid killed the non-avian dinosaurs, the Amazon was a rainforest of conifers and a few flowering plants. A layer of ash killed the conifers, giving the flowering plants a chance to prevail.
~
There is a river in the Peruvian Amazon called Shanay-timpishka that is so hot it boils animals alive. For years, Western science dismissed it as a legend because the Amazon is far from any active volcanoes (the usual heat source). However, it is real; the water reaches 200°F (93°C), heated by deep geothermal faults. If you fall in, you cook.
~
The Amazon River got its name from a hallucination -- or a misunderstanding. In 1541, explorer Francisco de Orellana claimed his expedition was attacked by fierce female warriors who fought alongside the men. Reminded of the "Amazons" from Greek mythology, he named the river after them. Historians now believe he either fought a tribe where women fought as equals, or he mistook long-haired male warriors for women.
~
While it looks like a weapon or a display flag, the toucan’s massive bill acts as a highly efficient thermal radiator. It is filled with blood vessels that the bird can constrict or expand. By rushing blood to the beak, they can dump excess body heat into the air, cooling themselves down four times more effectively than elephants do with their ears.
~
Toucans have a unique modification in their tail vertebrae that allows them to flip their tail feathers backward over their heads. When they sleep, they turn their heads around, tuck their long beaks into their wings, and cover everything with their tail, transforming into a compact, round ball of feathers.
~
If you looked inside a toucan's mouth, you might think it had a feather stuck in its throat. Their tongue is long (up to 6 inches), narrow, and lined with bristles on the sides, giving it a frayed, feather-like appearance. This texture helps them catch and guide food down their throat.
~
Toucans are often depicted as friendly fruit-eaters (frugivores), and while fruit makes up most of their diet, they are actually opportunistic omnivores. In the wild, they frequently raid the nests of other birds, eating eggs and even snatching hatchlings to snack on.
~
Although they are colorful and live in the tropics, toucans are not related to parrots. They belong to the order Piciformes, making them close cousins of the woodpecker. Like woodpeckers, they nest in hollows of trees (though they can't drill their own holes; they have to find existing ones).
~
You will rarely see a toucan soaring over the jungle canopy. Their wings are short and rounded, making them poor long-distance flyers. Instead, they travel mostly by hopping from branch to branch on their strong legs. When they do fly, it is usually in short, frantic bursts.
~
A baby toucan does not look like a toucan at all. They hatch completely naked (no feathers), blind, and with a standard-sized, wide beak. The iconic long bill does not begin to grow significantly until they are a few weeks old, and it can take months to reach full size.
~
Like their woodpecker cousins, toucans have zygodactyl feet. This means they have two toes pointing forward and two toes pointing backward. This arrangement gives them an exceptionally strong grip, allowing them to balance easily on branches while reaching for fruit.
