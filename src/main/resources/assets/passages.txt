The word jungle comes from the Sanskrit word jangala meaning uncultivated land.

While often used interchangeably with rainforest a jungle specifically refers to dense tangled undergrowth that allows little light to reach the ground.

The Amazon Rainforest produces approximately twenty percent of the world oxygen.

Rainforests cover less than three percent of the Earth surface but are home to more than fifty percent of the world terrestrial animal species.

About twenty five percent of all natural medicines were discovered in rainforests yet less than one percent of these plants have been tested by scientists for medicinal properties.

The canopy layer is so dense that it can take ten minutes for a falling raindrop to reach the forest floor.

Rainforests generate their own rain as plants release water through transpiration which evaporates and forms clouds that water the forest again.

The world forests absorb about two point six billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.

If you weighed all the ants in the Amazon the ants would weigh more than all the mammals in the Amazon combined.

The rainforest floor is so dark that less than two percent of sunlight reaches it.

Some rainforests like the Daintree in Australia are over one hundred eighty million years old dating back to the age of dinosaurs.

The cacao tree from which chocolate is made originated in the Amazon basin.

The Amazon River carries more water than the next seven largest rivers in the world combined.

The Amazon rainforest is fertilized by phosphorus rich dust blown all the way from the Sahara Desert across the Atlantic Ocean.

Rainforest temperatures rarely drop below sixty four degrees Fahrenheit or rise above ninety three degrees Fahrenheit.

It is estimated that a swath of rainforest the size of forty football fields disappears every minute due to deforestation.

For a long time scientists thought there was only one species of giraffe but genetic research suggests there may be up to four distinct species.

A giraffe tongue can be up to twenty inches long and is dark blue or purple to protect it from sunburn while eating leaves.

Female giraffes give birth standing up meaning a newborn calf falls about five to six feet to the ground to enter the world.

Baby giraffes known as calves can stand and run within an hour of being born.

Despite their long necks giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans just much larger.

Giraffes were long thought to be silent but they actually hum to each other at night at a frequency too low for human ears to hear.

No two giraffes have the same spot pattern it is as unique as a human fingerprint.

Giraffes have one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal needing only five to thirty minutes of sleep in a twenty four hour period.

A giraffe heart weighs about twenty five pounds and beats up to one hundred seventy times per minute to pump blood up to its brain.

Drinking water is dangerous for giraffes as they must spread their legs awkwardly to lower their heads making them vulnerable to predators.

Because giraffes get most of their moisture from plants they can go weeks without drinking liquid water.

A giraffe kick is powerful enough to kill a lion or decapitate a predator.

The knob like structures on a giraffe head are called ossicones.

Despite an awkward gait giraffes can sprint up to thirty five miles per hour.

Giraffes are the tallest land mammals with males reaching heights of up to eighteen feet.

The giraffe scientific name Giraffa camelopardalis comes from the ancient belief that they were a cross between a camel and a leopard.

Giraffes have the highest blood pressure of any mammal to combat the gravity fighting against blood flow to their heads.

The massive beak of a toucan acts as a radiator allowing the bird to cool itself down or conserve heat by controlling blood flow.

The toucan beak looks heavy but is made of keratin with a honeycomb like interior making it incredibly light.

Toucans are not great at flying and mostly hop between branches or glide short distances.

To sleep a toucan turns its head backward and tucks its beak under its wing and tail resembling a ball of feathers.

Despite having bright colors toucans blend well into the dappled light of the rainforest canopy.

Toucans are noisy and social birds often living in flocks of nearly twenty.

While toucans love fruit they are opportunistic eaters and will snack on insects lizards and even the eggs of other birds.

Unlike woodpeckers toucans cannot drill holes in trees and must find pre existing hollows to nest in.

The toucan tongue is long and frayed on the sides making it look like a feather.

Toucan chicks are born naked and blind and they stay in the nest for up to eight weeks.

Toucans are among the loudest birds in the jungle with calls that can sound like frogs croaking or dogs barking.

In some toucan species the bill accounts for nearly fifty percent of the bird total body surface area.

Toucans have been observed wrestling with their beaks and tossing fruit to one another during mating rituals.

Toucans are native to the Neotropics from Southern Mexico to Northern Argentina.

The Toco Toucan is the largest and most recognizable species famous for its black body and giant orange beak.

The main predators of toucans are forest eagles hawks and jaguars.

Toucans play a crucial role in forest health by dispersing seeds from the fruit they eat far away from the parent tree.

A black panther is not a specific species but a melanistic color variant of either a leopard or a jaguar.

If you look closely at a black panther in bright sunlight you can still see the rosette patterns hidden in the dark fur.

The dark coat of a panther acts as perfect camouflage for hunting at night a phenomenon known as ghosting.

Unlike most house cats jaguars and black panthers love water and are excellent swimmers.

The jaguar has the strongest bite of all big cats relative to its size capable of biting through turtle shells and caiman skin.

Leopards and black panthers are incredibly strong climbers and often drag heavy kills up trees to protect them from scavengers.

Panthers are generally solitary animals only coming together to mate.
